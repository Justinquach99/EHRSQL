# Acquiring Databases
First, have credentialed access to MIMIC-III and eiCU on PhysioNet. Download the MIMIC-III database from https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/ and the eiCU database from https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/2.0/.

# Preprocessing
Preprocess both MIMIC-III and eiCU databases for proper formatting and to be usable for training.
